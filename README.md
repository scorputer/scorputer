## About Me
👋 Hello, I'm William – also known as @scorputer on GitHub.

As a developer with over 20 years of experience in technology validation, I am passionate about learning more by experimenting with the integration of Artificial Intelligence into the development lifecycle. My goal is to leverage AI as a tool for streamlining workflows for developing and testing of hardware software and firmware.  It has been a grueling but hopeful journey so far :-)

## Collaboration
